# System Patterns

## System Architecture

- [x] Describe the system architecture:
  - The system follows a microservices architecture, with separate services for AI agent management, marketplace, and API integration.
  - The frontend is built using React and Next.js.
  - The backend is built using Node.js and Express.
  - The database is PostgreSQL.

## Key Technical Decisions

- [x] Document the key technical decisions made:
  - Choosing a microservices architecture to allow for independent scaling and deployment of services.
  - Using React and Next.js for the frontend to provide a fast and responsive user experience.
  - Using Node.js and Express for the backend to leverage JavaScript expertise and provide a scalable and performant API.
  - Using PostgreSQL as the database to provide a reliable and scalable data storage solution.

## Design Patterns in Use

- [x] List the design patterns being used:
  - Observer pattern for real-time updates and notifications.
  - Factory pattern for creating AI agents.
  - Strategy pattern for different API integrations.

## Component Relationships

- [x] Explain the relationships between components:
  - The AI agent management service interacts with the marketplace service to retrieve and share AI agents.
  - The API integration service interacts with the AI agent management service to enable AI agents to access external services and APIs.
  - The frontend interacts with all backend services to provide a user interface for creating, managing, and deploying AI agents.

## Critical Implementation Paths

- [x] Identify the critical implementation paths:
  - User authentication and authorization.
  - AI agent creation, management, and deployment.
  - API integration with external services.
  - Marketplace search and discovery.
