# **App Name**: NexOS

## Core Features:

- Persistent TopBar: A persistent, context-reactive element providing global shell access and agent interaction awareness.
- Dynamic Workspace: A modular and spatial environment for applications, supporting drag, resize, stack, pin, and security features.
- Context-Aware Layout: Application views adapt layouts dynamically based on the current context.
- Agent Visualization: Live agent presence and decision telemetry are visualized in every major view.
- Security Validation: Every user and agent interaction validates against the current security context.
- Loom Studio: Visual workspace and system debugger integrated into the core of NexOS. Uses an LLM as a tool for AI prompt injection sandbox built-in

## Style Guidelines:

- Futuristic off-white (#FAF9F6) provides a clean and modern base.
- Light gray (#EAEAEA), almost the same hue as the primary but desaturated.
- Gold (#D4AF37) for highlights and key interactive elements; chosen as analogous (30 degrees away from off-white).
- Comfortaa (sans-serif) for titles and user interface.
- Lexend (sans-serif) for use with the debugger environment
- Eliminate sidebar layouts; utilize zone-based spatial division to make interfaces dynamic.
- Responsive motion that reflects agent state/activity, providing real-time feedback.
