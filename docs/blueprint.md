# **App Name**: ΛΞVOS formerly known as NexOS

## Core Features of ΛΞVOS

AEVOS (ΛΞVOS) is a next-generation Intelligent Operating System — modular, agentic, and secure by design. Built around a persistent shell, context-reactive workspaces, and deeply integrated AI agents, AEVOS introduces a novel architecture based on **micro-apps** — dynamic, secure, self-contained functional units that plug seamlessly into the OS.

---

### 🧩 Modular Micro-App Architecture

Micro-apps are the atomic units of AEVOS functionality. Each one is:

- **Isolated and Purpose-Built** — Functions as a single-feature tool (e.g., "Performance Dashboard", "Security Surface Scan", "Prompt Canvas")
- **Context-Aware** — Reacts to the user's role, current task, and active agents
- **Agent-Extendable** — Includes hooks for BEEP or other agents to assist, observe, or automate
- **Secure by Design** — Scoped permissions and validation enforced per app context

Micro-apps can be launched manually or triggered by agent behavior, system events, or security anomalies.

### ⛩️ Persistent TopBar Shell

Always present, never in the way. The TopBar serves as the master control:

- System-wide navigation
- Agent indicators and execution overlays
- Global search, quick launch, and override controls
- Seamless theme/security mode toggling (e.g., Public, Dev, Admin)

---

### 🧠 Dynamic Multi-Zone Workspace

A drag-resizable, pin-able, stackable playground for your apps:

- Hosts multiple micro-apps simultaneously
- Supports app-to-app linking via agent context bridging
- Retains layout state per user session
- Reacts fluidly to input modality (mouse, touch, voice, agent injection)

---

### 🧬 Context-Aware Adaptive Layouts

Not just responsive — **responsive to your behavior**.

- Adjusts viewports, visibility, and emphasis based on active intent
- Dynamically resizes or collapses apps to maintain clarity
- Adapts security overlays and agent prompts without interrupting flow

---

### 🛰️ Agent Telemetry & Execution Visibility

BEEP and your agents don’t just operate in the background — they live in the interface.

- Visual overlays show what agents are doing and why
- Agent behavior trees and real-time action flows
- Control toggles for agent autonomy (observer, suggest, execute)
- Audit trail for agent-initiated app state changes

---

### 🛡️ Embedded Security Validation (AEGIS)

The AEGIS subsystem enforces frictionless zero-trust:

- All micro-apps validate against active user, session, and agent context
- Secure-scoped permissions (per app, per user, per role)
- Background scanning for anomaly detection across UI events, file I/O, and agent activity
- Unified security log with visual and programmatic access

> Built to evolve. Designed to protect. Powered by agents. Modular by nature.

## Style Guidelines:

- Comfortaa (sans-serif) for titles and user interface.
- Lexend (sans-serif) for body
- Elimutilize zone-based spatial division to make interfaces dynamic.
